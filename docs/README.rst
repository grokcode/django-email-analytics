Django Email Analytics
======================

Django Email Analytics adds Google Analytics tracking to emails sent
with Django. It provides a wrapper for Django's standard email backends.

Installation and Setup
----------------------

Install with pip:

::

    pip install django-email-analytics

Then set the email backend in the settings.py file.

::

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'emailanalytics.backends.AnalyticsEmailBackend'

Set ``EMAIL_ANALYTICS_BACKEND`` to the value you previously used for
``EMAIL_BACKEND``. Or if ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` was unset, you can leave
``EMAIL_ANALYTICS_BACKEND`` unset as well. This will chain the email
backends so that django-email-analytics will use your original backend
to send messages.

Options
-------

By default, URLs will be replaced only when the mimetype is text/html
and the URL occurs within a ``href`` attribute.

Set ``EMAIL_ANALYTICS_REPLACE_TXT`` to ``True`` if you would like to
also replace urls occuring in text emails.

Tracking details
----------------

If a URL already contains tracking parameters, they are left unchanged.

Otherwise, URLs are tagged with the following parameters:

-  ``utm_source`` is set to the subject of the email
-  ``utm_medium`` is set to ``email``
-  ``utm_campaign`` is set to ``webapp``

parameters <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?rd=2>`__.
